Roger.

1. Implement the "Builtin Math Plugin" (30% complete).

2. Implement enough of SkyWatcherAPIMount to do basic testing (30% complete).

3. Modify my coordinate conversion layer driver to use the new architecture.

4. Implement an example client program to load eqmod format databases into the alignment subsystem (50% complete).

5. Finish design and implementation of blob support in the alignment database (10% complete).


Q1. I want to use a robust matrix and vector math libary for the math plugins. My current candidates are Armadillo and GSL (GNU Scientific Library), both of which are readily available as packages on most major linux distributions. Comments and suggestions please.

The file compress.c contains (slightly modified) source code that originally came from gzip-1.2.4, copyright (C) 1992-1993 by Jean-loup Gailly. This gzip code is distributed under the GNU General Public License and thus requires that any software that uses the CFITSIO library (which in turn uses the gzip code) must conform to the provisions in the GNU General Public License. A copy of the GNU license is included at the beginning of compress.c file.

Similarly, the file wcsutil.c contains 2 slightly modified routines from the Classic AIPS package that are also distributed under the GNU General Public License.

Alternate versions of the compress.c and wcsutil.c files (called compress_alternate.c and wcsutil_alternate.c) are provided for users who want to use the CFITSIO library but are unwilling or unable to publicly release their software under the terms of the GNU General Public License. These alternate versions contains non-functional stubs for the file compression and uncompression routines and the world coordinate transformation routines used by CFITSIO. Replace the file `compress.c' with `compress_alternate.c' and 'wcsutil.c' with 'wcsutil_alternate.c before compiling the CFITSIO library. This will produce a version of CFITSIO which does not support reading or writing compressed FITS files, or doing image coordinate transformations, but is otherwise identical to the standard version.

/**
 * \defgroup observerFunctions Observer Functions: Inter-driver communication functions.
 
    <p>INDI Library employes the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern">observer pattern</a> to enable communication among devices using a publisher/subscriber mechanism. All drivers are by default publishers. The observer pattern permits a driver to monitor a property in another driver. The driver that monitors the value and status of a property in a different driver is called the \e subscriber driver, that is, it subscribes to the property of the other driver (the \e publisher). When the subscriber driver chooses to minotor a property, it can choose how it gets notified when the monitored property is updated. The \e subscriber can opt to receives notifications only when the monitored property \e status changes, or only when its \e value changes, or both. Furthermore, the \e subscriber provides its own callback function to process any updates from the monitored property. The callback function prototype <b>must</b> match the observed property type. That is, if the subscriber is watching a switch property, its callback function prototype must be that of a switch property.</p>

    <p>In addition to monitoring changes in status or value, the subscriber gets updated when the monitored property is defined, deleted, or dead. A property is dead when the \e publisher  driver crashes or severs communication with INDI server.</p>

    <p>Refer to the inter-driver communication tutorial under the <code>examples</code> directory of INDI for a typical implementation involving a dome driver that monitors the status of a rain collector. The dome driver subscribes to a light property called rain collector in the rain driver. When the property changes its status to alert, the dome driver promptly closes down the dome.</p>

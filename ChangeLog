From 0.4 to 0.5

	# Devices:

		+ True Technology Filter Wheel
		+ SBIG STV?

	# Other:
	     + Added INDI Observer pattern to enable flexible inter-drive communication.
	     + SBIG CCD driver was updated to fix problems with CFITSIO.
	     + Fixed INDI Mac OSX Crash.
	     + Updated TTY API to include error reporting, in addition to fixing a few bugs.
	     + LX200 Drivers use client timestamp to update the telescope internal clock. The old behavior was to use to system's time.

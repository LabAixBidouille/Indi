1. Pass in a reference to the in memory database when calling the math module along with a dirty flag.
However this will stop the math module working on a client without extra work. Do we need the math module to work on a client?

2. Finish off work on plugin management in AlignmentSubsystemDirver.

3. Finish implementation of database helper functions in AlignmentSubsystemDriver.

4. Implement AlignmentSubsystemClient.

5. Implement AlignmentSubsystemMathPlugin.

6. Implement the "Builtin Math Plugin".

7. Implement enough of SkyWatcherAPIMount to do basic testing.

8. Modify my coordinate conversion layer driver to use the new architecture.
